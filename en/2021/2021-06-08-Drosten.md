##### Beke Schulmann
For today, we also intend to deal in detail with the question of where SARS-CoV-2 comes from. This has been the subject of much discussion over the past year and there are various scenarios for the emergence of the virus. Roughly speaking, two directions. Some say SARS-CoV-2 was produced in the laboratory and then escaped. Others say it came about naturally. The theory that the virus has been transmitted from animals to humans has prevailed, i.e. that it is a zoonosis. 

But in recent weeks, the debate has flared up again. Several articles have appeared in the US, including New York Times, Washington Post and The Bulletin. Anthony Fauci, the US government's pandemic adviser, also said recently that he was not entirely convinced that SARS-2 originated naturally, i.e. that it was transmitted from animal to human. Mr Drosten, you and other researchers have already published a statement in the journal The Lancet, thanking the Chinese scientists and medical professionals for their efforts in the fight against Covid-19. And you write that you condemn conspiracy theories that suggest that Covid-19 has no natural origin. Wasn't it far too early to be sure that the virus had a natural origin? 

##### Christian Drosten 
I think we have to say this first, in order to come back to this statement by Toni Fauci that he is not completely convinced. No one can be completely convinced of this until the animal source has actually been identified. For example, for SARS-1, this has been identified quite unequivocally. You could do the same for this virus. But we don't have any data on that.

In this sense, there are certainly very few scientists, probably no scientists, who are completely convinced of this version of an animal source. Likewise, there are probably few scientists who are completely or at all convinced of a laboratory origin. You always have to look at how differentiated the discussion is and what is left of it in the shortening. We also need to look carefully at what things are actually said by scientists. 

For example, if you look at this relatively early Lancet publication, it was just a show of solidarity. This is a very short piece in the Letters to the Editor section where a group of scientists, including myself, and a lot of scientists who are really working on coronaviruses, scientists who are involved in similar research, just said at the time, 'You can't just say that without any evidence.' That they simply say: Aha, there is a laboratory, that is close to such an animal market. A lot of cases have been traced back to this animal market without even knowing whether there is a causality. And now we come to the conclusion that just because the laboratory had worked on coronaviruses in the past, the virus comes from this laboratory, without any proof, without any evidence. At that time, it was already heavily commented on in the media and in the political media. We, as a group of scientists, have resisted this method of communication and interpretation. This is simply impossible and unfair. As a matter of principle, we must assume that scientists who carry out serious academic research, even if they come from China and work in China, do not act maliciously and malignantly. We have to start from the basic idea that we do honest research. And that's what this statement was really about. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
That statement was later criticised in Germany, including by the newspaper Welt, for a conflict of interest. It's about Peter Daszak, who organised the statement and who is also an expert in the field of pathogens that are transmitted from animals to humans. Daszak is also the president of the Eco Health Alliance in New York. Several media outlets report that his organization has funded coronavirus research at the Institute of Virology in Wuhan. And from this, some authors now conclude that if SARS-2 had indeed escaped from the institute, Daszak might have been complicit, and with the statement he wanted to distract from it. Did you know before you co-signed or co-authored the statement that Daszak's organization was involved in research funding in Wuhan? 

##### Christian Drosten 
Yes, well, research funding is another matter. I knew they were working together, so Peter Daszak is working with Zhengli Shi in Wuhan. But that is not really a problem for me at the level of the statement at that time. This statement is not a scientific statement. It does not say anything scientifically hard, but simply says: we express our solidarity. That's perfectly fine. 

It is also okay for cooperation partners to say this for their Chinese cooperation partners. So of course a Peter Daszak, who is English, who works in the USA and works with a Chinese laboratory, can make a public statement by saying: Folks, these are serious, serious scientists. I know them, I work with them. Even now, that was far from unknown. So, of course, everyone who co-signed this letter knew that. And that is perfectly fine in that sense, too. I don't see any conflicts of interest here.

I must say, however, that I am someone who certainly takes a very neutral view of the matter. For example, when this letter was written, I was only asked to do so at the very end. This text was finished. Then it was sent to me and I was asked: Christian, do you want to sign here with us? You know your way around the community and you are also neutral. I read it through and said: "Yes, of course." I subscribe to that. I also think it is wrong to treat the people in China, the scientists, in this way. 

Now, of course, a lot of time has passed. Peter Daszak has now taken a leading role in the WHO mission, the purpose of which was to provide information there. I do think there is a conflict of interest. It just has to be there. In other words, you cannot go to a laboratory with which you have been cooperating for years as a neutral observer or inspector, or whatever you want to call it, inspector. You can't do that. Of course, Peter Daszak is not the only scientist on the commission. But the mere fact that he is in the Commission means that... this Commission has been in constant contact with each other again, and then again in a closed circle. They also spent weeks in a quarantine hotel. Needless to say, the Commission as a whole will no longer necessarily be neutral. So I just have to say that. This is certainly one of the things that can and should now be criticised about this WHO Commission. 

There are more recent statements from academia that have nothing to do with this journalistic review. For example, a statement paper in Science by a group of very serious scientists, not all of whom are really in the thick of the issue, but also real experts who say, it needs to be investigated better, investigated in a different way. And I totally agree with that. I would also criticise the current work of the WHO with this mission. Not just for this reason of bias, but for other reasons as well. So, for example, the process of how something like this came about, a Commission group that is closed, was not transparent enough in my opinion. This was advertised, but only to so-called Focal Points. In other words, only one point per country could ultimately be allowed by the experts. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
An institute? 

##### Christian Drosten 
Yes, right. Often these are research institutes, in Germany it is the Robert Koch Institute. The question, of course, is: would such a thing not have to be advertised in principle to a wider scientific public? And then really the best experts in terms of content, who really have their own specific research expertise on the subject, but who are not biased at the same time, wouldn't there have to be a broader call for proposals? And I think the WHO can learn a lot from that and hopefully will in the future as well. Then, of course, we must also ask whether this is the right course of action, in other words a country such as China, to which a Commission will then come and say: now we want to rummage through the cupboards here. Surely that cannot work. So you can criticise the political system in China any way you want, but that would not work in another country either. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
But do you have any idea how to do it differently? 

##### Christian Drosten 
Yes, of course. Just as science usually does. Not through a commission trip, which is accompanied with a lot of brimborium in the media. But it's basically over after ten days where you can't afford anything at all. But through a discussion process in the scientific public. For example, when an expert in Europe or the USA says: I have an idea. It was like that then... - why wouldn't you research it now? And when other experts say: Yes, exactly why not? This creates a scientific public that Chinese scientists and, of course, Chinese politics have to confront.

If, for example, more and more scientists in Europe and the United States are saying, 'Folks, you have a certain fur industry that works with animals that were the proven source of the virus in SARS-1, why have we not done any research on it to date?', then there will have to be a reaction to it at some point. If there is no response, then there will always be a big question mark at the crucial point. This is one such example. That's what science does. Science is already in the process of doing so. And in this way we also meet our Chinese colleagues on an equal footing. And if, at one point or another, Chinese scientists may not have the political freedom to carry out the research they want, then the whole of science in other countries can demand it. Politicians will then have to allow it. That's how it works. 

There are other games that don't always work with China. China is not the only country that should be on the agenda when it comes to policies for research. Science has its processes. And the process is certainly not a small visiting commission that then writes a report. And the report then reads as if some of the questions here had already been dealt with well in the short space of time. So that's really not acceptable to me.

##### Beke Schulmann 
We will certainly come back to this discourse and the fur industry later. I would like to come back to Peter Daszak. In many journalistic articles on laboratory theory, he is also referred to as a specialist in gain-of-function research. 
And maybe we'll get into the scientific details here. This gain-of-function research plays a major role in the theories surrounding the origin of the virus. 

##### Christian Drosten 
I have known Peter Daszak for many years, he is not an expert in gain-of-function research, he is an animal ecologist. He has a very different scientific background. We can define gain-of-function research in many ways. However, I believe that in this context it is now defined by working on pathogens, viruses, for example, pathogens, and giving them different characteristics either by means of breeding methods or genetic engineering methods, in other words by giving them different genetic markers, in order to see whether these genes then convey a different, perhaps even disease-enhancing or transmission-enhancing function. This is hardcore virus research, hardcore virology. It's not animal ecology. This is a very different subject.

Peter Daszak is coordinating a giant research consortium that includes American experts on viruses and Chinese experts on viruses. They have a certain common technological basis. I do not actually believe that it has been proven at all that this type of technology is made in China in this cooperation.

But I actually believe to this day that this is only done in the USA and that these viruses are then given to China for certain experiments or that these experiments are actually carried out in the USA. Only the source of the virus gene information in China lies at the site. Nor do I understand the details of this scientific cooperation. But what I understand is that Peter Daszak is an ecologist in person. So he can only comment from a very high level. And that's how he does it in public, so what you see in the media coverage are interpretations of what he says. And these interpretations, at least in the articles I've read, are often just plain wrong. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
Before we come to SARS-CoV-2 in particular, can you give us a little more insight into this gain-of-function research? What exactly is it all about? 

##### Christian Drosten 
In this context, we would be asking certain questions that are essential for assessing, for example, pandemic pathogens or pathogens that are, say, in an animal reservoir but may have the potential to become dangerous, initial indications. There is the famous example of gain-of-function research by Ron Fouchier and Yoshi Kawaoka, who carried out certain studies using the example of influenza H5N1. Where they have seen, there are certain virus variants in the animal kingdom, in waterfowl, where the influenza viruses come from - they have mutations, genetic constellations, that are suspicious that they might increase the transmission of these viruses in mammals. So these viruses just come from the waterfowl area. And we are interested in which of these incredible diversity of variants might be dangerous in mammals in terms of transmissibility. 

The experiments that they did then were that they could specifically modify the genome of influenza virus at the DNA level in a so-called reverse genetic system, which is a system that exists in the laboratory, so that we can genetically modify that. This is ultimately a set of bacteria plasmids that can be modified in the laboratory. Let's say we're rescussitating it. Now, with the help of such a system, we can also produce viruses in the laboratory that we have not taken directly from nature in the form of a living virus. So we just sequenced a piece of bird droppings in a field study. Then we got the genetic information from influenza viruses there and looked at and compared many influenza virus genomes. There were a few of them, they have certain mutations that seem suspicious to us. But we do not have this virus in our hands. We only have the gene information. 

What we could normally do naturally in virology is: we could put this piece of bird droppings into a cell culture and hope that there is now a virus growing, a naturally replicating virus. Only if you have thousands of genome sequences, that would translate into thousands of faecal samples that needed to be studied in cell culture. That's just not on. This is not logistically feasible. If we now want to proceed in such a targeted way, then we insert these conspicuous mutations from the genetic information into such a reverse genetic system and then, in principle, artificially created the virus. It is a one-to-one copy of what occurs in nature and you have that in the laboratory. 

What's more, if you have several different variants of such conspicuous viruses in the sequence information - then you can combine these conspicuous variants in the same virus in such an artificially created virus. So if you say that there is a possibly reinforcing mutation here, that there is another mutation in the other virus and that there is a third one here, then you could proceed, and that is what has been done, to bring them together. 

##### Beke Schulmann
Why do they do this? 

##### Christian Drosten
This is what you do to ask the question, if we can do it in the laboratory, nature will certainly do it if it brings an advantage to the virus. And this question is asked: Does it bring an advantage? Do we have to concentrate on this viral line? Do we have to say: Aha, something dangerous is brewing in nature. We're proving in the laboratory that it can be dangerous if these two or three evolutionary lines that now exist in nature in parallel and that will certainly come together at some point, if we put them together in the laboratory and we see the virus that comes out of it, that's more transmissible in ferrets, for example, so the laboratory animal for influenza is the ferret, then we know that's dangerous. And that is precisely what these two working groups in Europe and the USA have done. That is why there has been a long-running debate, which in principle is still going on, about the benefits and potential harm of this type of research. Whether you can do that at all. And if so, how to control it. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
Exactly. In other words, it can actually create a dangerous virus in the lab. As you have already mentioned, there are those who say that this modification of viruses should be banned completely because, in theory, something more dangerous could arise. However, this would not make any sense at all if further research could not then be carried out on, for example, vaccinations or medicines. Or is it? 

##### Christian Drosten 
I am not saying that this should be banned completely. However, there are scientists, and sometimes they are scientists who are not involved in virology or in the core area of this virus research, who sometimes say this in a relatively general way. I have a much more nuanced view. I think it's for essential questions of infection biology. I can get theatrical about this now, these are the big questions of our time in this kind of research. You have to do these experiments, otherwise you can't answer the questions. And we simply have to realise at some point that we, as humanity, would then make the decision: 'Nope, better not. So it would be better not to proceed with the progress of knowledge, rather not to grope further along the boundary of knowledge, but rather to leave it out of a precautionary consideration.'

Or perhaps we want to take a different approach to the precaution by saying: wait a minute, but we can control it. We know what we're doing. We have safety laboratories. We have certain biological safety measures. 

We can also design experiments in such a way that the information comes out, for example, of an increase in hazards, even though we have previously reduced the overall hazards. So in the virus with a downgraded danger, we then put in a research mutation. Then we can see that, relative to the original state, it becomes more dangerous, but it is far from having the danger of what exists in nature. This is how this research can be carried out. These are the execution variants that you know if you are really an expert. Then that's a level to discuss.

Contrary to the level at which you discuss when you talk to non-professionals who simply express emotional opinions, who may also want to make themselves more important. If this is then taken up by a certain shortening of reporting, then we end up in a really absurd discussion, which does not help either, which generates attention, but this attention is not productive. In other words, we can no longer find common solutions, whereas these solutions do exist and these solutions are already being pursued in many countries. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
Turning now to SARS-CoV-2, it has a particularly effective method of penetrating human host cells. It is now being discussed that this trait may have arisen through genetic manipulation in the laboratory. And there is the so-called furin cleavage site in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, which gives rise to these speculations about its origin. Please explain again exactly what this is about. 

##### Christian Drosten 
The furin cleavage site is a protease detection site. And the protein that is on the surface of the virus, that has to be cut into two parts to function well. This cutting into two parts could be done by the virus itself, but in this case it does not have the necessary enzyme on board. There are viruses, including the influenza virus, and other coronaviruses, which take advantage of an enzyme in the cell. This enzyme is in the secretion pathway that the cell provides for the production of viruses. As the virus passes the site, the enzyme, a cellular enzyme, becomes active. This is recognized by this so-called furin cleavage site. The enzyme is called furin. This then cuts the virus protein into the appropriate pieces. Just as the virus needs it.

This is one of the many examples of how the cell does the job for the virus, reluctandly. This makes the virus at many stages of its replication. Now it's the case that SARS-1 coronavirus and many others, I'm not saying all, but almost all other known SARS-like viruses, so the members of the species 'SARS-related coronavirus', that's a species, a species, a virus species. These conspecifics of the SARS coronavirus, they don't have such a cleavage site. The most closely related virus known to date from the conspecifics of the SARS virus does not have it either. This SARS-2 virus has them all at once.

And now it has been argued in media articles that this must have been artificially introduced for several reasons. 'Firstly, there are several nucleotides at once that have come into it. So this cannot be a gradual mutation, but rather a whole series of new bases that have been introduced here. Evolution does not do this by itself in such a short time.' It has been calculated that this closest relative species and the SARS virus may have separated evolutionarily from each other in the range of 50 years ago. They had their last common ancestor. 'It is unacceptable that so many new bases should be added in such a short space of time.' 

So at this level, the argument is made by journalists who write off other journalists. They have spoken to scientists again, but they are not really in the field. That is my view of the new media coverage currently prevailing in the United States. It must also be said that the first corrections are under way. So the first major American newspapers correct themselves and also apologize for false reporting. This correction has not yet arrived in Germany. But I think there will also be corrective mechanisms. 

But to come back to biology. We have here this view that this furin cleavage site must have been artificially inserted for this reason. Because so many new traits do not come into a genome in a short time, in this short time of evolution. 
There are other arguments that go much deeper, or try to go deeper. For example, one argument is that by encoding amino acids in genetics, we often have several ways to spell out the same amino acid in the form of RNA or DNA. Now it's like we're talking about a codon, so that's three nucleotides in a row that encode an amino acid. We have a different preference of codons for the same amino acid in different organisms. The arginine codon, for example, which occurs here in this furin cleavage site, twice in a row, is CGG. 

It is now argued that this arginine codon, which is actually quite rare in coronaviruses, and the fact that here an arginine codon is used in the virus, which is more in line with the preference in mammals or in vertebrates at all, suggests that this should be artificially inserted. This is actually the genetic code of a furin cleavage site, just as it would be found in the human cell or in other cells or even in animals. If this is an atypical occurrence in the virus, it is also a sign that it has been inserted artificially. This is because geneticists work with such animal sequences, while the virus would use codons other than CGG. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
But you wouldn't say that? 

##### Christian Drosten 
No. I don't agree with that at all. It is the case that these arguments have long been known in science of other viruses, they are not really valid. These have been clarified especially for the SARS-2 virus in the scientific community, in the expert community and the corresponding publications have been published. In fact, this doubt has been debated and clarified in science since last spring, practically from January-February, since the genome came out. In short, it is normal that viruses in nature sometimes acquire such furin cleavage sites. We know this enough about avian influenza, so in the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza, a furin site is acquired. And we also know from avian influenza that the source of this furin site is not the simple evolutionary drift, i.e. the point mutations and then random addition of bases, but there are essentially two mechanisms behind it. One is a basic additional error mechanism in the replication enzymes of these viruses. Put simply, these enzymes can stutter. They can sometimes insert the same thing twice in a row, even though this was not specified in the template. That is one of the mechanisms. 

The other mechanism is well known from influenza: the furin cleavage site occurs in many, many proteins in the cell. The cell needs this for itself, for its own protein production. Viruses replicate in such rough quantities, such huge numbers of genome copies, that even rare accidents of evolution simply occur with some regularity and also come to light when they bring an advantage to the virus. After all, we only ever see the viruses that have survived the selection processes. So we only see the successful viruses. Experience has shown that it is precisely here in the cell that pieces of genes from human proteins are incorporated into the virus genome via recombination steps. These are steps that are fully understood in their mechanism of how this works. Only we know it rarely works.

However, when a virus replicates in large quantities in many animals or in many cells, rare things happen. These come to light when, in retrospect, they are useful for the virus. With influenza, we know very well that these things happen. 
We also know this for other viruses that have been studied in the molecular-biological laboratory. And the fact that animal-typical codons appear here in the furin cleavage site is anything but surprising, but is actually expected when this virus has acquired itself through recombination steps, this furin site, let's say.

##### Beke Schulmann 
If you say that these are not reasons for the virus to come out of the laboratory, do you think it is possible that researchers in the laboratory have inserted a furin cleavage site into the coronavirus in this way? 

##### Christian Drosten 
Such a thing is possible. I think we need to ask more: Excluded or proven? In fact, in these categories, there is a public debate going on. At the moment, this cannot be proven or excluded on the basis of the available data. Technically, a lot is possible. Anything is possible in molecular biology. It is often not likely that someone has done this in a line of research, because it simply would not make sense. I think we need to talk about that. It is speculated, especially in these media articles, that the evidence came together in such a way that certain events indicate that this must have been a laboratory accident. So someone has actually done experiments in good will and something has escaped. Or could have somehow become infected in the lab. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
And then carried it out. 

##### Christian Drosten 
Exactly. We have this argument that inserting a furin site into a virus is an obvious experiment to see if it makes the virus more transmissible. That would be such a conceivable background for such an experiment. A reasoning. Now you have to know: It is not necessarily the case that if you insert a furin site into a virus, that the virus is better or more transmissible afterwards, but on the contrary. The likelihood is that this will not do much good for the virus. So these viruses do not always have an advantage. If a furin site is contained in a glycoprotein, then in many cases this glycoprotein also causes it to mature prematurely, as we say. So it comes prematurely matured out of the cell. And then decisive steps are disrupted in their course of time. So this protein processing, this cutting into pieces, that has to happen in a certain time sequence. And if a furin site is inserted, this can lead to the maturation occurring too early and the virus has practically already shed its powder for maturation steps, which are later necessary to allow entry into the next cell to be infected. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
That is, it would then be rendered harmless? 

##### Christian Drosten 
Yes, right. This can also affect a virus. Well, that's just for starters. Of course, it would be an interesting experiment to introduce a furin site to such a virus, and that is technically possible. The only question is: How would you do it from the point of view of the experiment? You would say: Okay, you have to do it with reverse genetics. To do this, you need a template virus that you want to build into the furin site. And this template virus, you would take an existing reverse genetics system, because it takes years to build such a system. This is really a very, very complex matter. So that's not completely true, by the way. There have been accelerating steps lately, but they were not available at the time when they should have been. It takes years. 

But you would, of course, save yourself those years, and simply take an existing system, for example a system for the SARS-1 virus that exists, and insert a mutation there. But that is not what would be needed here to explain it. To explain this, one would first have to demand that scientists have built a completely new reverse genetics system from a previously unknown virus and then introduced a furin site there.
 
So I once used the picture for laymen in a newspaper interview, so that you can understand it better. It's like trying out the sound of a new car radio. I don't take my car and install a new radio and listen to what it sounds like. But I'm building a brand new car from scratch. When that is done, I will install the new radio. It just doesn't make sense. You wouldn't do that. 

So I'm not saying it's unthinkable that someone would be so crazy to do that. Of course, it is also inconceivable that there is an evil, sinister force somewhere that does such a thing with evil intentions. Then we would get out of the laboratory accident and into a completely different discussion. None of this can be ruled out with a purely last option, but these media articles argue quite differently, on a completely different level. It is argued that you only have to put one and one together, then the clues come together. 'Slowly it is clear that this is coming from the laboratory.' That is completely wrong, that is not the case. 

It is not one and the same thing, but rather the exact opposite. You have to say that if someone had done that, it must have been a pretty special person. Or that would be very, very awkward. So there would have to be quite a lot of strange circumstances coming together to explain why this should have happened. But without saying now, and this is really always important to me, we have no definitive evidence, and rare things can sometimes happen, that is clear. So you always have to keep an open mind. Just this bias in the media, which is just not acceptable to me as a scientist. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
And if we do not assume bad intentions, well, we do not imagine an evil scientist standing in the laboratory and saying: I want to produce a dangerous virus. Could it be that a scientist stands up and says: I am not taking the original virus, which is already there, but I am producing it very expensively in order to produce another virus, because I want it to look as natural as possible, so that it is not discovered that I have done this?

##### Christian Drosten 
No, a scientist would certainly not do that. So let's say an active scientist who is as motivated as scientists are, because we want to publish the results. So that's what science is all about. It's not about hiding anything. Why put years of work into something that no one knows about? So if I went to work every day as a scientist and my boss never actually finds out what I'm doing in the laboratory, then my employment contract will probably not be renewed at some point. That's certainly not what motivates scientists. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
You have already touched on it, if you summarize again, how can such a furin cleavage site have arisen, if not in the laboratory? 

##### Christian Drosten 
So we know purely molecular biologically there are many possibilities that happen in the cell and that presuppose that relatively much virus replicates. So to do that, you would have to put virus in cell cultures for a relatively long time. And this is also a conjecture in certain media reports that this was caused by serial passage in cell cultures. Or the virus would have to be replicated in animals, amplified in a large group of animals, passed on. And at some point that coincidence would happen. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
How realistic is it that this has come about? 

##### Christian Drosten 
We ourselves have worked relatively hard on SARS conspecifics in Europe, which occur in south-east Europe and south-west Europe. We have also tried for a long time to isolate viruses in cell cultures. We never managed to do that. This is how many laboratories around the world have tried it. Zhengli Shi is actually the only laboratory in Wuhan that has managed to isolate a virus for once. It seems rare for that to happen. 

And to get something like that, you usually have to take culture cells, which we say are particularly permissive. So the most readily allow the virus to replicate. There is a group of cell cultures, these are Vero cells, which simply allow the replication of almost all mammalian viruses when they enter the cells, particularly well. So they have certain defects in their immune system. They are used for such passages. I know that Zhengli Shi used them in the laboratory as well.

Here we have to say: If you do that, then practically the first thing that happens with the SARS-2 virus is that this furin site is destroyed in the virus. So when we isolate SARS-2 virus from patients in Vero cells, this furin site goes away immediately, because this is a selection disadvantage for the virus in cell culture. This is because the cell entry mechanism in the culture cells is different from that in the respiratory tract. The furin site is an obstacle to this alternative cell entry mechanism in culture cells. And it applies to many, many other culture cells as well. 

Thus, not only for Vero cells, but for the overwhelming majority of all culture cells, the fact is that the pathways that the virus needs in the respiratory tract and for which it also needs the furin site are either very few or non-existent in these culture cells, and the virus in cell culture rather enters the cell via alternative pathways, and the furin site is a hindrance to this. Therefore, as a virologist who is really experienced in this matter, I am a bit sceptical as to whether the furin site can really have been created in a cell-to-cell passage in the laboratory. However, I would like to add that in the case of other viruses that use other entry mechanisms, including influenza, a serial passage can lead to the formation of a furin site. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
If the team around Zhengli Shi has already succeeded in Wuhan, can it not be that it was the same again this time? 

Christian Drosten 
Again, this is such a weighing-up, it has to be said that we cannot exclude all of this. I don't want to rule it out. I can only talk about my experiences and give a little bit of probabilities. So ultimately, if the scientific community asks the questions, then laboratories in China will also answer those questions. But please, on an equal footing. You do not visit laboratories with which you actually want to work at eye level and then try to rummage through the cupboards there. After all, these are fellow scientists on an equal footing, who can fit into a scientific discussion and discussion process and provide their contributions and answer questions. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
And if we now look at this real passage in a natural way, i.e. in the animal world, how does it happen? 

##### Christian Drosten 
I would perhaps say at this point: We know that these coronaviruses, especially the SARS species, come from Rhinolophus bats. These are certain horseshoe bats that form large populations in caves. We have karst and limestone caves over large geographical areas in the area in China. And many of these habitats are populated by horseshoe bats. There is certainly a lot of viral infection on the way. In these animal populations, of course, any evolutionary advantage can also arise and be used. Like, for example, the evolution of such a furin cleavage site. 

It is quite conceivable that very closely related virus lines of this great diversity sometimes have properties that are then different in detail. I have to say, for example, that I also read in these media articles that the SARS conspecifics viruses, i.e. the viruses related to the SARS virus, all have no furin site, which would be quite unusual here, so it must have been produced artificially. This is not true. It has even been published, a virus has already been described, a SARS species with a furin cleavage site. 

I can also say from my own experience that we have also worked for a long time on fellow SARS viruses in Bulgaria, Romania, for example, in these countries. And in our work, some of which have not yet been published, because we did not consider this to be so urgent at the time, we have already seen that there are signs that furin cleavage sites form here and there and can also degrade again in evolution. This is what viruses do, they acquire such properties and lose them again. That's a little bit of their ecology. Thus, the competition of the different virus lines against each other is carried out in nature. In this respect, I would say that such a virus with such properties exists in nature, is completely unsurprising, completely normal. The only question is: can we get it there?

Of course, this has now also been dealt with in media reports, where it has been said that either laboratory staff whow are doing field work. Or else, there are these miners who are being talked about, who have been infected with the virus in these caves. First of all, as a field worker in bat research, a great deal of bat research is being done, and certain protective measures are being taken. But they are often not as strong as we have in the laboratory. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
That means you could theoretically get infected with bat droppings? 

##### Christian Drosten 
Yes. 
So sometimes you go into the caves. But what you actually do is work in front of the caves and catch the flying bats or bats in the net. This is what you do with rhinolophides in particular, using certain traps. There are nets and traps for that. You don't go into the cave and scratch the bats from the ceiling, that's not how it works. So you have to be careful when working in the fields. According to the hypotheses, the virus is apparently suspected of being infectious from the fecal samples. But that is not our experience. The virus concentration we see in faecal samples of these bats and these viruses is low, as is the case with many other coronaviruses. The detection rate is rare. These excrement samples dry up immediately and in a dried excrement sample, you have to imagine that like a mouse with such a size, the virus is then also broken. That can't survive. I am not sure whether these coronaviruses are actually transmitted between animal species in this way. I don't think it's that likely that you get infected. 

And on the other hand, of course, all we know... For example, we know nothing about the laboratory staff. There are echoes in the media of a master's thesis and a doctoral thesis from China, where this has probably been described. I looked at this master's thesis as a translation and you actually see X-rays and general clinical descriptions of pneumonia. But you don't see any indication in this work that it was tested at all for SARS-like viruses. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
The issue is that miners have been infected, directly at bats. 

##### Christian Drosten 
Exactly. There is also seems to be a doctoral thesis. A scientific paper then quotes and refers to additional material, which is probably part of this doctoral thesis. I have also looked at this additional material. These are English translations. Unfortunately, I cannot read Chinese. I have not seen this original doctoral thesis, but these literature excerpts in this scientific essay. I really have to say that there is a scientific paper that says: 'You can see here in the work and here is the proof that tests have been carried out for SARS viruses.' Then you look at the footnotes and there is something completely different in them. This is not about testing for SARS viruses. I have to ask what the quality level of this scientific paper is. Journalists quote from it again, and they are quoted again by other journalists. And so rumors make their way into the media. 

But it is always the case here, if you go to the source, as you can at least as a western scientist, then you come across: nothing. I don't think that's fair. I think that's just bad journalism when things like that happen. So if you cite sources that you haven't checked. And yes, that let's me frown a bit, if you meant that with frowning.

But what actually makes me frown even more is the gap that exists on the other side. We are now talking about directly infecting bats, by whatever mysterious circumstances. But we know for the SARS 1 virus, and as I said, this is a virus of the same species, that this virus was present in fur animals, in certain species of civets and also in raccoon dogs. This is scientifically conclusive evidence for the SARS-1 virus. And now, of course, we know that species of viruses very often have the same ecology. In other words, they have the same hosts, the same hosts of origin, but they can then take the same route in their transfer from animal to animal on the basis of community ecological conditions.

Let me give you the simple example I gave in a recent newspaper interview. These animals, which have a relatively synchronized birth season, these bats. And in the birth season virtually even the stillborn bats, which have a high neonatal mortality, fall. So even dead animals in the cave fall from the ceiling. The civets and raccoon dogs and so on, these are small predators that often know when it's time. They then go in there, eat themselves full and they can get infected naturally. We also know very well that the coronaviruses in this bat population boil up during the birth season. We think this is due to two effects. The mothers are slightly immunosuppressed under and around birth for reasons, as is the case with mammals. At the same time, many immunologically naive offspring are born here, who can then also absorb and multiply the virus. And for these reasons, we are seeing an increase in both prey for predators and an increase in the virus in bat populations. In almost 20 years of work, we have proved this in literature together with many other groups working on the same subject in competition. So that is the state of the art.

It is also state of the art that raccon dog and civet species with this SARS-1 virus have been found again and again in China. We know, for example, that the SARS-1 virus was acquired not once but at least twice by humans from this source, from these small furry animals, predators. And that is why the assumption that the same transmission route for the SARS-2 virus can now be easily interrogated and researched is more than obvious. In other words, you would have to go and systematically sample such animals for the presence of coronaviruses.

##### Beke Schulmann 
But that's not what they do. So for SARS-2, the intermediate host has not yet been discovered. This also gives rise to the theory that one says: Okay, if it is not searched for, then it must have either been transmitted directly from bats. Or you just know that it comes from the lab. In comparison, with SARS-1, this intermediate host was found relatively quickly, after only a few months, right? 

##### Christian Drosten 
True, it was known about SARS-1 after just under a year. Several competing working groups have tried to do so. Animal markets were sampled at the time, relatively close to the SARS-1 outbreaks, particularly in Hong Kong, and Shenzhen. 
So in Shenzhen you have seen a lot and in other areas in southern China. And found it at animal markets. These animal markets were then regulated. Certain animal trafficking has been banned.

There is also always confusion in these media reports between SARS-1 and MERS. It is then spoken of bats as a source of MERS. You can see the poor journalistic quality of these articles. Especially this article in the Bulletin, that is really very poorly researched. Serological studies were made. These are farm animals. And in the case of livestock, it is easy to say: Okay, many veterinary institutes are of course working on other diseases of these livestock species. They have, of course, research collections of serums, blood samples from animals that have been tested for antibodies to anything else. They are frozen. You can then defrost and test them. It was immediately apparent, as we were participating at the time, that not the other livestock species, but the camels, have practically one hundred percent antibodies to MERS coronavirus. In other words, this is a teething problem for them. All adult animals have seen the virus.

So now we have to compare SARS-2 exclusively with SARS-1 and not with MERS. This comparison has no place here. And with regard to SARS-2, it has to be said that it is true that there is no literature at the moment on the search for this virus in animals in fur production. We have an article in Nature Communications which, at least for the Wuhan market, presents a study on the composition of wild animals in this market. It is said that raccoon dogs, for example, have been found in the trade, although this was probably prohibited. But it was probably not properly controlled. But that doesn't mean anyone was looking for the virus. So now you only have - and this is actually a scientific publication, you have to imagine the finding: yes, raccoon dogs were traded in the Wuhan market at the time. Now I wouldn't see the source in such a market. So that's a couple of animals. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
They are kept in a cage. 

##### Christian Drosten 
Sure, there are five or six animals for sale somewhere in baskets and cages. But these are snapshots. In other words, a very small group from a larger animal population at a certain point in time when the virus does not necessarily have to be there. I would rather suspect something else: namely these furry animals, which are bred for use in large herds. If people trade in these animals at markets, then these traders will always go to where the animals are bred, because of course they buy for the market. One can imagine that people who work on the market as sellers have contact with the breeding stock of these animals, where hundreds and thousands of these animals are bred in one place for fur production and become infected there as human beings. That could be, you could imagine. But it may also be that simply the people who slaughter these animals for fur harvesting become infected. They are close to the animals. 

These animals, if they have a virus epidemic at the moment, in other words, if a virus infects the fur stock and infects animal after animal, then the virus is also released from the lungs and intestines of these animals, in this rather brutal slaughter process. This is where people may become infected. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
Does that mean raccoon dogs are the most plausible intermediate host for you? 

##### Christian Drosten 
All I want to say is that this is a species in which there is no doubt that a link has been established with the SARS 1 virus. I know that they are bred as fur animals in China. And breeding on this scale encourages the emergence of viral outbreaks. I also know that these animals are certainly always supplemented by wild animals. These wild animals, i.e. wild raccoon dogs, can then re-introduce the virus because they have become infected in the wild as predators while eating bats. Such a thing is conceivable and possible. And that, for me, would be a reference, for example, which I have already made several times in public last spring. I said it here in the podcast and in the other media pieces, I would just look it up. And I would also recommend Chinese scientists to look there. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
But why is this not done? It should be in the interests of the Chinese scientists. One could thereby refute this very laboratory thesis. 

##### Christian Drosten 
So you can conjecture about that. It may be that Chinese scientists do not get permission to do so, perhaps because they do not want to see it from the political side. It's maybe a bit embarrassing. Also because, after SARS, the trade in these animals was stopped. On the other hand, we know relatively well that there is this fur industry in China. This is well documented in the media and is very credible. We see this when we buy jackets with fur on the hood, poodle hats with such a fur pompom or jackets. If that's real fur, that beige-gray fur that's sometimes a bit spotted, that's Chinese raccoon dog. This is, of course, a large textile industry.

Perhaps there is also an interest in protecting or shielding this industry in some way, because it also makes money. I can only guess at this point. This is also outside my field, is not my expertise at all. However, as a virologist who is experienced with this virus, with this kind of field research and so on, I would recommend that a high priority be given to scientific investigation. Which, of course, can and should be done purely in China and by Chinese scientists. 

I would like to say one more thing. In fact, we have had outbreaks in Denmark, for example, in mink stocks. The SARS-2 virus, as we now know, can even be transmitted backwards into such furry animals, which are, by the way, all somewhat related to each other, of course, these are carnivores. We also know from experimental studies that the raccoon dog is directly infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. This has even been done in Riems, among other places, by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute there is a publication on it. They have the opportunity to infect such rare animals in this large-scale research facility, where such animal experiments can be carried out, and they have done so. It's going really well. 
So this SARS-2 virus that infects these animals and that is also passed between animals. That's published. And now we have to look at what has been done in Denmark? Well, we have seen that this virus is spreading in the stocks, and then these stocks have been culled. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
Killed. 

##### Christian Drosten 
Yes. So you killed all the animals in a very short time. Then, of course, the virus is gone. If we now rebuild these breeding stocks ourselves, it will not come back so quickly. Or if it comes back, it will probably come back in another variant. What I mean by this is that it is conceivable that, in the run-up to the SARS 2, the Covid 19 pandemic, such a virus could have appeared in such breeding flocks in China and then been culled. So perhaps Chinese scientists or regulators have even done such research and then culled it, perhaps to prevent it from spreading further, in a cautious manner. And we wouldn't even find this virus in such studies today. Unless samples had been stored at the time. So you always have to add that.

If we now say, from the perspective of a European workplace, so well-intentioned, "Oh, go and test these animals," then perhaps you will find it. Perhaps we are no longer able to find it today. And I want to add something else. It is quite conceivable that this did not happen in China, but in another country, where such fur animals are also traded and bred, perhaps also in exchange with China. I am not aware of that either. I have no knowledge of this.

There are certainly scientists and animal husbandry experts, animal trade experts, who could answer whether there is such a trade relationship with other countries in which such animals are bred. Somewhere in China, I have now found a figure of 14 million raccoon dogs, which are bred in China for fur production. That's a big number, of course. But I do not know what is happening to other countries in the region. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
This means that it is possible that the virus was transmitted from fur animals to humans, but that it can no longer be found there? 

##### Christian Drosten 
Exactly. We must also somehow come to terms with the pain of not answering or of not being able to answer for the time being, without looking at each other with contempt. I would like to stress again and again that the reputation of Chinese scientists in the West is high. We don't look down on Chinese scientists. And we basically don't consider Chinese scientists to be influenced, because that's not our experience. We see the contributions of Chinese scientists as full-fledged science. I just have to say that in such an appreciative way. This really has no political implications. 

I can also say, for example, that just so I'm not understood here as someone who is, let's say, pro-Chinese: What China did around the SARS-1 epidemic was really not good. They were really trying to hide information. Gro Harlem Brundtland, then the UN Secretary-General, publicly condemned China for its behavior around the SARS-1 pandemic. This is all publicly documented, of course. However, in this area in particular, where I can judge it, I cannot and do not want to judge anything else in public that I know about China, but here I can perhaps say a bit from an insider's view of the field that China has learned a great deal in processing this data, in dealing with such infectious diseases. We also see, of course, what happened in China in the control of the pandemic after it went wrong, how quickly and how ruthlessly the response was then. Here too, of course, one might say that this would never be done in the West. This has to do with certain concepts of freedom that you cannot drive in the West. That's all very well. But we are making a technical point here. And on a technical level, I don't think there are any big mistakes being made in China at this point. Except for this one point, which I really must point out here and repeatedly point out, there is a crucial gap in the investigation of the animal source. 

##### Beke Schulmann 
In other words, what must we do now to find answers? 

##### Christian Drosten 
So we just need a scientific process. And this process has been going on for a long time. We last had this opinion in Science from a group of scientists. Of course, the WHO should moderate here. Of course, the WHO should take up such scientific impulses and relay them back to China, through diplomatic channels. The WHO is a UN organisation. This is, of course, a high level of diplomacy. And here, of course, things have to be achieved.

I also think, however, that such highly symbolic actions as a visit mission, which China obviously did not want in the first place - for understandable reasons, in my opinion - should be corrected. That is not how one would imagine such problems to be solved, but one would imagine it to be done in a cooperative manner. It must also be said, of course, that if China really does not want something and has something to hide at this point, then it will not be possible to enforce it through such activities. Even then, at some point in a scientific discussion process that takes place in public, people will say: well, now we have urged them enough. We will probably never get the answer. Now everyone can draw their own conclusions.
