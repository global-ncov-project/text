Concerning trying to identify these three hundred million mammalian viruses: As you know, there are many viruses which are non-pathogenic. Is there a way to sort of parse that down to make it a much more economically productive thing to do? Also we know that there are non-mammalian viruses that can also cause disease, and it doesn't make sense really to limit ourselves to.

Second question, concerning the water thing. lower manhattan intolerant the 19th century that was started it wasn't that they were interested in supplying water they were interested in developing a bank And they applied to the state to get a charter for a bank. But the deal was, and Aaron Burr was one of the people who was involved in development of Manhattan, Aaron Burr was one of the people. And they were... the deal was that in order to get a charter for the bank, they had to develop a water system. And that's how it happened. So they weren't really interested in getting water at all.

My point is, I think it's the profit motive and greed that drives a lot of people here. And I don't see a solution to that unless we change our whole society the way culturally we do it. I think we're so driven by the profit motive... You know, Winston Churchill said Americans try everything first and eventually they'll do the right thing. I think it applies to human beings in general. Human beings will try everything and then eventually they will do the right thing. I don't know how long it is going to take us to get there, but I am somewhat cynical.

Yeah great question. I'll continue in reverse order, so I want to answer the second question first.

Why mammals? Well if you do the math on the previous emerging disease events, the vast majority of the zoonotic - the viruses that come from animals, the ones that go pandemic - tend to come from mammals. So if you cover mammals, you cover the vast majority of future pandemics. That's why we chose mammals. You should probably include birds, too, because of avian flu being such a threat. But we've have done the maths on that - it doesn't increase the cost too much. But the first question is more difficult.

You know, you are right, it's a stamp collecting excercise. But some of these stamps are penny blank, and some of them you got to throw them out. Some of these viruses will be killers, some of them won't. How do we work that out from a viral sequence? It is not straightforward.

So as an example: First of all, we're only looking at viral families that include those that have got into people from animals. So we narrowed it down straight away. Then when you get a sequence of a virus and it looks like a relative of the known nasty pathogen, just like we did with SARS... We found other coronaviruses in bats, a whole host of them, some of them looked very similar to SARS. So we sequenced the spike protein, the protein that attaches to cells. Then we... Well, I didn't do this work, but my colleagues in China did the work. You create pseudoparticles, you insert the spike proteins from those viruses, see if they bind to human cells. And each step of this, you move closer and closer to this virus that could really become pathogenic in people. So you narrow down the field, you reduce the cost. And you end up with a small number of viruses that really do look like killers.

Then you look in people, and you say... And the people that live in the region where this animal lives that are exposed to that virus - do we see antibodies specific to that virus? There is the first evidence, just as the groups out in cameroon are showing of a new virus spilling over into people. What are they doing, what is the high risk activity? Can we find an alternative? So it is not straightforward, but there are ways we can hone it down. And I think we've just got to do it. It just makes sense, economically and for humanities' sake.
